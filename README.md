# 🎬 Video Player Project 🎬

Welcome to my Video Player project! This project started with a template that had some CSS for appearance.
I've expanded upon it by adding HTML, JavaScript, and a bit more CSS to create a fully functional video player.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

In this project, I focused on building a video player using JavaScript, aiming to understand how to manipulate user interaction and animations.

## ✨ Purpose

The main goal of this project was to learn the following aspects of video player functionality:

- **Play & Pause**: Implementing functions to play and pause the video.
- **Progress Bar**: Creating a progress bar to track and control the video's current time.
- **Volume Controls**: Adding volume controls to adjust the audio level.
- **Mute and Unmute**: Functions to mute and unmute the video.
- **Playback Speed**: Changing the playback speed of the video.
- **Fullscreen Toggle**: Enabling and disabling fullscreen mode.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Enhanced my understanding of JavaScript by implementing video player controls.
- **Event Handling**: Improved my skills in setting up and managing event listeners for various video controls.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Strengthened my ability to manipulate the DOM to create interactive and user-friendly web applications.
- **CSS Styling**: Applied additional CSS to improve the visual appeal and user experience of the video player.
